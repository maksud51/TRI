    "about": "While studying for my Bachelor's in Software Engineering at Daffodil International University, I took an elective in machine learning and was instantly hooked. It was like I'd found a missing puzzle piece that brought all my interests together - math, statistics, programming and problem-solving. My first job was a Data Scientist under a professor of my university, where I was the youngest team member. But don't let that fool you - within my first year, I was leading a project. Numbers don't lie. This achievement still makes me proud. I've found that the drive and determination needed to tackle rough trails translates well into my professional life. It's allowed me to better understand how to handle complex data sets, and ultimately, how to turn raw data into actionable insights. If you're looking for someone who can make sense of big data and drive results for your company, I'd love to chat. You can reach me at salimsadman615@gmail.com.

I’m especially interested in how GenAI and machine learning can be applied to solve real-world problems in practical and impactful ways. Currently, I’m working on my undergraduate thesis focused on rice disease detection using lightweight YOLO-based CNN models. Through this, I’m learning about model design, feature extraction, and performance optimization — and gaining hands-on experience with real-world datasets. I’m actively building my skills in Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and other deep learning frameworks. I enjoy learning by doing. I’m now seeking internship or entry-level opportunities in ML, DL, CV, or GenAI, where I can contribute, continue learning, and grow under mentorship.

When building modern web applications, both React.js and Next.js are popular choices. However, each serves different purposes and offers unique benefits. Here’s a comparison to help you decide which is best for your project: 📌 React.js: The Library for Building User Interfaces • Purpose: React.js is a JavaScript library focused on building reusable UI components. It handles the view layer of an application and allows developers to create dynamic, interactive web pages. • Flexibility: React.js provides the flexibility to build your application’s architecture from scratch. You can choose your own routing, state management, and other tools. Community & Ecosystem**: With a vast community and rich ecosystem, React.js has countless libraries, tools, and resources available to extend its capabilities. • Client-Side Rendering (CSR): React primarily uses client-side rendering, where the entire application is loaded in the browser. This can sometimes lead to slower initial load times and potential SEO challenges. 📌 Next.js: Framework of react • Purpose: Next.js is a framework built on top of React.js, designed to streamline the development process and enhance performance with out-of-the-box features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). • Built-In Features: Next.js offers built-in routing, image optimization, and API routes, reducing the need to configure these aspects manually. It’s an opinionated framework, making decisions for you to simplify development. • SEO & Performance: With SSR and SSG, Next.js significantly improves page load times and enhances SEO, making it ideal for content-heavy or e-commerce sites. • Fullstack Capabilities: Next.js also allows you to build fullstack applications with API routes, enabling you to create backend functionality within the same project. 🔥 When to Use React.js: 1) Flexibility Required: If you need full control over your project’s structure and want to pick your own tools and libraries, React.js is ideal. 2) Building Single-Page Applications (SPAs): React.js excels at creating SPAs where SEO isn’t a primary concern. 🚀 When to Use Next.js: 1) SEO & Performance Focused: If you’re building an application where SEO and fast load times are crucial, Next.js is the better choice. 2) Quick Development: With built-in features and conventions, Next.js helps you get projects up and running faster without sacrificing performance. ✨Conclusion:- Use React.js if you need maximum flexibility and prefer to build your application architecture from the ground up. Opt for Next.js if you want a more streamlined, performance-oriented framework with built-in features that make development faster and easier.

You can use `fetch` for a simple approach, `axios` for more advanced features, or `useEffect` with `async/await` to manage side effects in functional components. For real-time data, consider WebSockets or libraries like `SWR` and `React Query` for caching and background data syncing. 🛠️ #ReactJS #WebDevelopment #FetchData #APIs #JavaScript #FrontendDev #Programming #SoftwareDevelopment #TechTips #ReactHooks #WebTech #DeveloperLife #TechStack #DevCommunity … more ways to fetch data in react js 7 pages 1 / 7 0 35 reactions 35 1 comment • 2 reposts Like Comment Repost Send Jayed Bin Harez reposted this Muhammad Zubair • 3rd+",

    "about": "While studying for my Bachelor's in Software Engineering at Daffodil International University, I took an elective in machine learning and was instantly hooked. It was like I'd found a missing puzzle piece that brought all my interests together - math, statistics, programming and problem-solving. My first job was a Data Scientist under a professor of my university, where I was the youngest team member. But don't let that fool you - within my first year, I was leading a project. Numbers don't lie. This achievement still makes me proud. I've found that the drive and determination needed to tackle rough trails translates well into my professional life. It's allowed me to better understand how to handle complex data sets, and ultimately, how to turn raw data into actionable insights. If you're looking for someone who can make sense of big data and drive results for your company, I'd love to chat. You can reach me at salimsadman615@gmail.com. Let's talk about how we can turn your data into a competitive advantage.",

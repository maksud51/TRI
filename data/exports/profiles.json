    "about": "While studying for my Bachelor's in Software Engineering at Daffodil International University, I took an elective in machine learning and was instantly hooked. It was like I'd found a missing puzzle piece that brought all my interests together - math, statistics, programming and problem-solving. My first job was a Data Scientist under a professor of my university, where I was the youngest team member. But don't let that fool you - within my first year, I was leading a project. Numbers don't lie. This achievement still makes me proud. I've found that the drive and determination needed to tackle rough trails translates well into my professional life. It's allowed me to better understand how to handle complex data sets, and ultimately, how to turn raw data into actionable insights. If you're looking for someone who can make sense of big data and drive results for your company, I'd love to chat. You can reach me at salimsadman615@gmail.com. Let's talk about how we can turn your data into a competitive advantage.",

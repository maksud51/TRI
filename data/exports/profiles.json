This opportunity marks an important step in my journey in AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science, and I’m honored to contribute at a leadership level. In this role, I aim to: 🔹 Support students and members in advancing their technical skills 🔹 Facilitate hands-on workshops, projects, and research activities 🔹 Strengthen collaboration between academia and industry 🔹 Promote innovation and responsible AI practices within our community Thank you to the faculty advisors, club executive board, mentors, and peers who trusted me with this responsibility. I’m excited for what’s ahead. … more Starting a new position 10 reactions 10 1 comment Like Comment Repost Send Shah Nawaz • 2nd Machine Learning | Deep Learning | Computer Vision | AI 1mo • Edited • 🚀 Bringing Explainability to AI-Based Brain Tumor Diagnosis After months of research, I’m excited to share the demo of my system — “Explainable Brain Tumor Diagnosis using ResNet • ViT • ResViT.” This project compares three powerful architectures — ResNet-50, Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16), and our hybrid ResViT model — for classifying MRI brain scans into glioma, meningioma, and pituitary/other tumors. 🧠 The most exciting part? Each prediction is explainable through Grad-CAM heatmaps, letting us visualize where the model focuses when identifying tumors — a major step toward transparent and trustworthy medical AI. 🎯 Built with PyTorch, Streamlit, and TensorBoard, this tool enables real-time inference and comparative visualization across multiple deep learning models. 📘 Next Step: Expanding this into my another undergraduate thesis titled: “Hybrid Deep Learning with Multi-Head Cross-Attention for Explainable Brain Tumor Diagnosis on Mobile Devices.” 🎥 Watch the full demo below 👇 #AI #DeepLearning #ExplainableAI #BrainTumor #MedicalImaging #GradCAM #ComputerVision #Research #PyTorch #Streamlit #ViT #ResNet #ResViT #HealthcareAI #Innovation #MachineLearning … more This is a modal window.

For ResViT, there’s a toggle to view CAM from the CNN last conv or the ViT last block. Overlays can be downloaded as PNG. 4.App: Streamlit UI to test a single model or compare all three, with an optional ensemble (simple average). Upload limit raised to 500 MB to handle big images. 5.Repo polish: clean structure, CLI scripts, and all plots saved per-experiment under experiments/exp*/figs/. 🎥Bumps I hit (and fixes)🎥 1.Labels looked “swapped” (Normal ↔ Malignant). Root cause: class-order mismatch (training uses alphabetical folder order). Fix: auto class-order detection from evaluation.json + display-order selector in the app. 2.ModuleNotFoundError: pytorch_grad_cam. Streamlit was using a different Python than my conda env. Fix: install grad-cam from GitHub and launch with python -m streamlit from the torch_gpu env. 3.import src failing. Packaged the code (pyproject.toml) and installed editable via pip install -e .. 4.Upload cap stuck at 200 MB. Added .streamlit/config.toml with maxUploadSize = 500. 5.Git push rejected (remote ahead). Resolved via git fetch + git pull --rebase, then pushed new assets (incl. data.png & folder.png). 🎥Try it locally🎥 conda create -n torch_gpu python=3.11 -y conda activate torch_gpu python -m pip install -e . python -m streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py 1.Upload checkpoints (best.pt or best_temp_scaled.pt) + a CT image 2.Flip ResViT CAM (CNN ↔ ViT) 3.Download Grad-CAM overlays as PNG 4.If predictions look “off”, upload evaluation.json to auto-map label order … more This is a modal window.

During my academic journey, I explored both manual and automation testing, where I learned how to design test cases, identify bugs, and ensure software reliability. I’ve completed hands-on projects using tools like Playwright, Postman, Newman, and Allure Report — focusing on web and API testing. I enjoy learning new technologies, solving real-world problems, and continuously improving my testing skills. My goal is to start my professional journey in an environment where I can grow as an SQA Engineer, contribute to a collaborative QA team, and deliver high-quality software products.",
